            In 1630s New England, English settler William and his family—wife Katherine, 
            daughter Thomasin, son Caleb, 
            and fraternal twins Mercy and Jonas—are banished from a Puritan Plymouth Colony over a religious dispute. 
            The family builds a farm near a large, secluded forest and Katherine bears her fifth child,
            Samuel. One day, when Thomasin is playing peekaboo with Samuel, the baby abruptly disappears. 
            It is soon revealed that a witch has stolen the unbaptized Samuel, killing him and using his remains to make a flying ointment.

                Katherine, devastated by Samuel's disappearance, spends her days crying and praying. 
                While hunting with William, Caleb questions if Samuel's unbaptized soul will reach Heaven.
                William later reveals to Caleb that he traded Katherine's silver cup for hunting supplies. That night, Katherine questions Thomasin about the disappearance of her cup and suspects her to be responsible for Samuel's abduction. 
                The children overhear their parents discuss sending Thomasin away to serve another family.

                Early the next morning, Thomasin finds Caleb preparing to check a trap in the forest and forces him to take her with him by threatening to awaken their parents. 
                In the woods, they spot a hare, which sends their horse into a panic. Their dog Fowler gives chase to it, in which Caleb pursues them. The horse throws Thomasin, knocking her unconscious, and runs away. Caleb becomes lost in the woods and stumbles upon Fowler's disemboweled body. 
                He finds a hovel where a beautiful young woman seduces him. The woman's arm becomes old and decrepit and grabs Caleb.

                William finds Thomasin and takes her home. Katherine angrily chastises Thomasin for taking Caleb into the woods.
                William reluctantly admits that he sold Katherine's cup. Later that night, Thomasin discovers Caleb outside the home in the rain, naked, delirious, and mysteriously ill. The next day, the twins converse and sing songs with Black Phillip, the family's billy goat, and accuse Thomasin of witchcraft; Thomasin's attempts to milk the nanny goat produce only blood. When Caleb awakens, he expels an apple with a bite mark from his mouth. Katherine urges the family to pray, but the twins claim to forget the words and become unresponsive. 
                Caleb passionately proclaims his love to Christ before he dies.

                William, believing Thomasin is a witch, tells her she will be put on trial when the family returns to town.
                Thomasin points out William's sins and accuses the twins in retaliation. Enraged, 
                William seals Thomasin and the twins inside the goat house. 
                Thomasin denies being a witch, but the twins do not answer when she asks if they have truly spoken to the goat. 
                Thomasin overhears William break down and confess to God that he has been prideful and made his family leave their old village out of stubbornness rather than sincere religious devotion. Later in the night, the children awaken in the goat house to see an old woman drinking milk from the nanny goat. Katherine awakens to a vision of Caleb holding Samuel. Caleb offers Samuel to Katherine and asks if she will look at a book. She chooses to breast feed the baby, 
                but it is actually a raven that pecks at her breast, leaving her bloody in the morning.

                William awakens and finds the stable destroyed, the goats eviscerated,
                the twins missing and an unconscious Thomasin lying nearby with blood-stained hands. 
                As Thomasin awakens, Black Phillip gores and kills William before her eyes. 
                An unhinged Katherine, now blaming Thomasin for the tragedies and misfortunes and accusing her of trying to seduce William and Caleb, attacks her, 
                who kills her mother with a bill hook in self-defense.

                Alone, Thomasin hears chiming and enters the stable, 
                where she urges Black Phillip to speak to her. 
                The goat responds by asking if Thomasin would like to "live deliciously" and materializes into a tall, 
                handsome, black-clad man. He orders Thomasin to remove her clothes and to sign her name in a book that appears before her. 
                Thomasin follows Black Phillip into the forest, where she joins a coven of witches holding a Witches' Sabbath around a bonfire. 
                The coven begins to levitate and a laughing Thomasin joins them, ascending above the trees.
